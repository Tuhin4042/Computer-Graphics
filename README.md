# Village Scenario Simulation

This project presents a detailed simulation of a village environment using OpenGL, showcasing animated and interactive elements that bring the village scene to life. Designed with attention to realism, this simulation features multiple environmental transitions and interactive components.

## Features

- **Boat Movement**: A boat moves naturally along the river, adding realism to the village atmosphere.
- **Day-Night Cycle**: A smooth transition between day and night, changing the background colors to reflect the time of day.
- **Rain Effect**: Toggleable rain effect with animated raindrops, enhancing the weather simulation.
- **Dynamic Background**: Different background colors for day and night settings.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows toggling of weather (rain) and time of day (day/night) modes to explore different environmental conditions in real-time.
- **Realistic Physics**: Elements like raindrops move with realistic physics, enhancing the immersive experience.

## Dependencies

- OpenGL
- GLUT

## Installation

1. Make sure OpenGL and GLUT libraries are installed.
2. Compile the code using a compatible C++ compiler.
